Demo scene requires "Post Processing Stack" package, its free and can be downloaded here: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/83912

Please note that this package needed only for demo scene. Model itself doesn't require any packages.

Also keep in mind I'm not a coder and scripts in demo folder are basic and for demo purposes only.
